## Installing the PlaygroundProject 2D Game Toolkit

To get started with the final project you need to install a copy of the PlaygroundProject 2D game toolkit. The toolkit provides a set of building blocks so that you can focus on the design of your game. The toolkit makes it easy to put together a playable prototype of your game idea.

### Installation steps:

1. Launch Windows Explorer (**not** Internet Explorer). Look for this icon near the Start Button in the lower left hand corner of your primary monitor.
<img src="" width="50%">
1. Then navigate to the shared folder for our class: _P:\Instruction\Urner_Douglas\Urner_Douglas-**<our block #>**\Collaboration_.
1. Copy of the **PlaygroundProjectTemplate** zip archive by typing ***Control-C***.
2. Next, navigate to the folder where you keep your games – _U:\Game Design_ or something similar.
3. Paste the **PlaygroundProjectTemplate** zip archive into the folder by typing ***Control-V***.
2. Then extract the compressed folder – right-click and choose **Extract All** from the context menu.
1. Launch Unity.
1. Choose Open at the Startup dialog and choose the **PlaygroundProjectTemplate** folder that you just created. If you don't see the **PlaygroundProjectTemplate** folder it is very likely that you skipped decompressing the zip archive.
1. Once Unity is launched explore the sample projects in the **Examples** folder. Each folder in the Examples folder is a game, to launch the game open the folder and double-click on the scene file.

### Your assignment:

There are two parts to your assignmnent for today:

1. Play a few of the games in the `Examples` folder. Each one is playable, but none is a fully developed game. You are likely to find bugs or things that you would like to change. **Make notes about the games that you play and the bugs you find and the ways you see to make them better.**

  Your note should include:
  * The name of the game.
  * A description of the issue – explain what goes wrong, or describe how  the game could be improved.
  * Give a list of steps to reproduce the problem.

2. Complete this assignment by making a screen capture (do a "Window Snip" to get the whole Unity window) of the most significant issue you found in the example games – try to set up the game to illustrate the issue that you found. Upload your screen capture as your submission for this assignment.
